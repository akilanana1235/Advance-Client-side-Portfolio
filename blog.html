                    On Monday, November 11 at 9:56 a.m. EST, 14:56 UTC, SpaceX launched 60 Starlink satellites from
                    Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40) at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida.

                    Falcon 9’s first stage supported the Iridium-7, SAOCOM-1A, and Nusantara Satu missions, and the
                    fairing was previously flown on Falcon Heavy’s Arabsat-6A mission earlier this year. Following stage
                    separation, SpaceX landed Falcon 9’s first stage on the “Of Course I Still Love You” droneship,
                    which was stationed in the Atlantic Ocean. You can watch a replay of launch below and learn more

                    SpaceX's Starship and Super Heavy launch vehicle is a fully, rapidly reusable transportation system
                    designed to carry both crew and cargo to Earth orbit, the Moon, Mars, and anywhere else in the solar
                    system. On Saturday, September 28 at our launch facility in Cameron County, Texas, SpaceX Chief
                    Engineer and CEO Elon Musk provided an update on the design and development of Starship. You can

                <h2>DRAGON RESUPPLY MISSION (CRS-18) SPLASHDOWN</h2>
                <h5><time datetime="2019-08-29"></time>AUGUST 29, 2019</h5>
                <p class="article-para">
                    Packed with about 3,300 pounds of cargo and science, SpaceX’s Dragon spacecraft departed the
                    International Space Station on Tuesday, August 27. A parachute-assisted splashdown in the Pacific
                    Ocean occurred that afternoon just west of Baja, California. A recovery team then secured Dragon on
                    a boat for the return trip to the Port of Los Angeles, wrapping up SpaceX’s 18th resupply mission to
                    the space station.

                    Filled with approximately 5,000 pounds of supplies and payloads, Dragon launched aboard a Falcon 9
                    rocket on July 25, 2019 from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida, and arrived at the space
                    station on July 27. The Dragon spacecraft supporting the CRS-18 mission previously supported the
                    CRS-6 mission in April 2015 and the CRS-13 mission in December 2017. Dragon is the only spacecraft
                    currently flying that is capable of returning significant amounts of cargo to Earth.

                    On Tuesday, August 6, SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket successfully lifted off from Space Launch Complex 40
                    (SLC-40) at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida, carrying the AMOS-17 satellite for Spacecom.
                    Liftoff occurred at 7:23 p.m. EDT, or 23:23 UTC and the satellite was deployed approximately 31
                    minutes after liftoff.

                    This was the third and final flight for this particular Falcon 9 first stage, having previously
                    supported the Telstar-19 VANTAGE mission in July 2018 and the Es’hail-2 mission in November 2018.

                    Dragon arrived at the International Space Station on July 27, 2019 and was captured at 6:11 a.m. PDT
                    while flying about 267 statute miles over the coast of southern Chile. The spacecraft was then
                    installed on the Harmony module for the duration of its four-week stay at the orbiting laboratory.
